# web_scraping
Program started as a program to scrape CodeTriage.com, as the package name implies.
The tuturial I  started with was https://stackabuse.com/web-scraping-the-java-way/ however that quickly became insuficient and 
I pieced together other tutorials to create a craigslist scraper, and thhen created a GUI for the application.
TO DO:
-Better input Parsing
-Option to prin to console or folder (see Windows.update1())
